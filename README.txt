GDP Prediction from EIA Energy Data
===================================

This modeling project predicts quarterly GDP values from energy consumption
data. Since energy consumption is directly affected by weather (specifically,
temperature), this data is augmented by surface temperature data. Since these
data are all available in near-real time, a prediction based on these data can
be produced in a much more timely fashion than traditional economic statistics.
